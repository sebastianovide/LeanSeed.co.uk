    <h1>The Lean Seed</h1>
    <p>The Lean Seed is maintained by Sebastian Ovide, strong supporter of the lean principles, passionate about startups, agile evangelist, natural born geek.</p>
    <p>As lead engineer of the <a href="https://geovation.uk">Geovation hub</a>, Britains's pionering location data hub, I'm builing a team that supports startups on going live with their MVPs as soon as possible. I am pragmaticaly frugal, which means that I keep things as simple as possible maximasing the real business value delivered with the minimal costs.</p>
    <p>At the same time I provide techical advice to early stage startups acting as a partime CTO. I help them to develop the MVP, choose the right technologies and building a great tech team.</p>
